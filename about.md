## FAQ

#### WHO?

Oh, who am I? Great question! I am kierke, 11 year veteran of the destiny community, former recurring stream character, boomer, rock climber, unhinged league stat poster in MrMouton's chat. Masters last season, GM this season Copege.

#### Why?

I really don't know. I am in therapy to get over my process addiction with this community - seriously, this isn't a joke.

#### Where are these stats from?

I am using the riot third party dev API to pull info from `Matches v5` endpoint. I am running those through a python script to compile things I think are interesting data points.

#### Why doesn't the site update?

I am just serving the site statically from a really cheap server. If interest expands I will hook up an actually webserver / database / start doing more interesting stuff.

#### Is this a meme?

To me, no. But I'm pretty unhinged and I recognize that :^) - help me get better, [patreon.com/dggg](patreon.com/dggg)
