#### Psychosis

A great man once said,
> "In order to say I am experiencing psychosis, these [critics] need to demonstrate a failure in my ability to logically reason."

Examples of break downs in logical reasoning might include:
> _P1_: I don't play normals because I am a competitive player \
> _P2_: Competitive league players will spend time learning what champs do \
> _(P1 ∧ P2) → Q_: [INVALID] I won't spend 5 minutes learning what champs made or reworked after 2016 do

or..

> _P1_: I base my decisions on research and defer to collective consensus of experts, not one single experts or anecdotes \
> _P2_: I want to improve my decision making in league \
> _(P1 ∧ P2) → Q_: [INVALID] I should autopilot game spam instead of spending 10 minutes researching modern jungle tracking, wave management, etc.

An example of valid and sound logic:
> _P1_: I want to have fun and be competitive playing league of legends soloQ \
> _P2_: I play ADC \
> _P3_: ADC in s12 is not fun and not competitive in soloQ \
> _(P1 ∧ P2 ∧ P3) → Q_: I will switch roles in s12

#### Dunning-Kruger

Either Kierkegaard or Kierke, I forget which one said it:

> "S5 mid-diamond knowledge no longer applies in S12, in order to succeed you must switch roles or adjust your playstyle and learn more about the game"

The Dunning–Kruger effect is the cognitive bias whereby people with low ability at a task overestimate their ability... that's all I got for this one :^)
